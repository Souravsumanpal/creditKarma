"This has been most anxious, stressful, hair pulling, banging my head in the wall experience I ever had. First they offered me a loan and then after I submitted all the documents some bot William kept emailing saying I didn't submit all the documents. I kept responding by attaching the same documents again and again just to get automated response saying that my question is forwarded to next available representative. When I finally got to talk to someone, they read your emails half way only and provide nonsense answer and they didn't even look at the previous email they sent me which is in the sane thread. Each time they ask for more documents ( some my bank says they don't provide) and they say if I can't provide the documents then their initial offer of 16 percent interest will be 29 percent interest ( which is same as my credit card which I am trying to pay off by lowering interest rate). Oh yeah and bot William is still sending me same email. Some of their customer service representatives are quite illiterate and speak to you like we are on a bazaar not like we are dealing with professional financial institution. I counted on that money due to their promise and it gas been a nightmare.","Jul 30, 2021",Horrible experience

"Easy application and I got the consolidation loan fast, but then it went downhill from there. Their system was broken so it wouldn't accept any of my credit cards to be paid off. Then it took a week to hear from them and instead of fixing the problem, they cancelled the loan. They are so unprofessional that I worried they are going out of business. Not worth the risk to deal with them.","Jul 21, 2021",Too risky to deal with their difunctional system.
This is an incomplete review. I am about to receive my funds. But the timeliness of the response and the terms of my debt consolidation loan seem to be pretty on track and exactly as described so far. I will be back with a timely update.,"Jul 22, 2021",TO BE CONTINUED....
