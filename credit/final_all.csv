"Jul 30, 2021","This has been most anxious, stressful, hair pulling, banging my head in the wall experience I ever had. First they offered me a loan and then after I submitted all the documents some bot William kept emailing saying I didn't submit all the documents. I kept responding by attaching the same documents again and again just to get automated response saying that my question is forwarded to next available representative. When I finally got to talk to someone, they read your emails half way only and provide nonsense answer and they didn't even look at the previous email they sent me which is in the sane thread. Each time they ask for more documents ( some my bank says they don't provide) and they say if I can't provide the documents then their initial offer of 16 percent interest will be 29 percent interest ( which is same as my credit card which I am trying to pay off by lowering interest rate). Oh yeah and bot William is still sending me same email. Some of their customer service representatives are quite illiterate and speak to you like we are on a bazaar not like we are dealing with professional financial institution. I counted on that money due to their promise and it gas been a nightmare.",2,2,Horrible experience

"Jul 21, 2021","Easy application and I got the consolidation loan fast, but then it went downhill from there. Their system was broken so it wouldn't accept any of my credit cards to be paid off.

Not worth the risk to deal with them.",2,2,Too risky to deal with their difunctional system.
